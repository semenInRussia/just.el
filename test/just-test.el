got an extra pair right here. Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White. Thanks Noob Noob, this guy gets it.

kind to read into there! Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We

Haha god-damn! We will returnâ€¦ in possibly different clothing. Aids!

Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty?
There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode
where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! Dont look at me! That
guy over there roped me into this. I dunno, some people would pay top
dollar for that kind of breakthrough. I'll be with Reuben in my
workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's
proverbial paradise.")
